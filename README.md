# Synced SVN
The Synced SVN contains a bunch of open-source projects that players may contribute to.
The SVN's purpose is to convey examples, allow open-source configuration, and contribute to the community.

If you want your creation to be added to the SVN, then please make a GitHub issue with the download link 
and please state what type of creation it is.
