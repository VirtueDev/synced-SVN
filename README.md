# Synced SVN
The Synced SVN contains a bunch of open-source projects that players may contribute to.
The SVN's purpose is to convey examples, allow open-source configuration, and contribute to the community.

If you want your creation to be added to the SVN, then please make a GitHub issue with the download link 
and please state what type of creation it is.

# Building the site.
You are required to install haxe version 2.4.0 (If neccessary, restart the computer). After that go over to the projects folder and go into website folder. Once you are in you will need to first install templo which you can do that by typing in haxelib install templo. After you install it close the command prompt and double click on build.hxml. You will notice that a www folder is created. (Ofc idk how I got it created in the first place but horray.)
