# Scribble
This program is a clone of Aduros' "Scribble" 
It was open-source, so we decided to implement it into Synced Online (www.syncedonline.com).

The actionscript files are pre-compiled and ready to go.

# Server Agent
Whenever uploading the game to Synced, type the server agent class as "scribble.server.Server"

# Wordsketch
In order for wordsketch to work, you need to upload a Level Pack in Synced and the ident must be "wordlist"
Then you have to list the wordlist.txt in order for it to work.
Each new line in the wordlist.txt is a new word wordsketch may use.
